# Design Philosophy

This theme is built on a few core design principles:

- **Less is More**: Only include what's necessary — no bloat, no fluff.
- **Principle of Least Surprise**: Keep everything predictable and easy to reason about.
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Only used when needed (e.g., theme toggle, search), and always kept lightweight.
- **Accessible by Design**: Semantic HTML, responsive layout, screen reader friendly.
- **Dark/Light Mode Support**: Honors user system preferences, with the ability to toggle manually.
- **Future-Friendly CSS**: Uses CSS variables and a modular SCSS structure that could be swapped for Tailwind or similar in the future.
- **Modular and DRY**: Post listings, styles, and layouts are reusable and avoid repetition.
